# Lab Title: EC2 Instance Type per Workspace using Terraform Workspaces

## Objective:
Dynamically create an EC2 instance with a different instance type depending on the active workspace (dev, staging, prod).

## Steps:

1. Create three Terraform workspaces:
   - dev
   - staging
   - prod

2. Define an EC2 instance resource in `main.tf` with instance_type decided based on the active workspace:
   - dev     -> t2.micro
   - staging -> t2.medium
   - prod    -> t2.large
